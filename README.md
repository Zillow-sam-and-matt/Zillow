### Identifying the Drivers of Churn at Telco

## Background

Why are we doing this project? How does this benefit Zillow? The data team?

## Goals

Our goal for this project is to create a model that will acurrately predict the values of single unit properties that the tax district assesses. The model will be created using the data of properties whose last transaction was during the monthes of May and June 2017.

We will deliver the following: 

- zillow_project.ipynb
    - A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the data science pipeline as it relates to each phase of this project.
    
- README.md
    - A Markdown file containing the project description with goals, a data dictionary, project planning, instructions for recreaction of the project and its findings, key findings and takeaways. 

- acquire.py
    - A Python file containing a function to acquire the customer data
    
- prepare.py
    - A Python file containing functions that prepare the customer data to be worked with
    
- A walkthrough-style presentation that summarize our findings about the drivers of the single unit property values. 

- zillow_presentation.pptx
    - A PowerPoint file that contains the slides used in the presentation
